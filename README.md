# üî§ Adaxi

Adaxi was collectively designed by a team of designers and non-designers during ["Bari Citt√† Aperta"](https://baricittaperta.xyz) XYZ workshop by [La Scuola Open Source](https://lascuolaopensource.xyz), 8‚Äì17 July 2025, and released under the SIL Open Font License 1.1 in 2025.

Adaxi is a display typeface available in a single style, enriched with multiple stylistic set alternatives. Designed for experimental use, it will remain a work in progress, with new glyphs added over time. It performs best at large sizes and when mixing different stylistic sets.

Basic letterforms were designed using [GTL](https://github.com/bbtgnn/GTL-web) (https://github.com/bbtgnn/GTL), with grid based system and squared pixels. Stylistic sets were developed by modifying, moving points and stretching the original sources.
